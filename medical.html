          <h1>IOT <a href="https://www.peerbits.com/blog/internet-of-things-healthcare-applications-benefits-and-challenges.html">Medical and Healthcare</a></h1>
		    <p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.peerbits.com/blog/mobile-healthcare-revolutionzing-industry.html">healthcare industry</a>&nbsp;is in a state of great despair. Healthcare services are costlier than ever, global population is aging and the number of chronic diseases are on a rise.</p>
		    <p><img src="images/internet-of-things-healthcare-applications-main.jpg" alt="internet of things healthcare applications main" width="725" height="400"></p>
		    <p>What we are approaching is a world where basic healthcare would become out of reach to most people, a large section of society would go unproductive owing to old age and people would be more prone to chronic disease.</p>
		    <p>Isn&rsquo;t it the end of the world we suspected? Whatever,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.peerbits.com/internet-of-things-iot-applications-development-company.html">IoT app development</a>&nbsp;is at your rescue.</p>
		    <p>While technology can&rsquo;t stop the population from ageing or eradicate chronic diseases at once, it can at least make healthcare easier on a pocket and in term of accessibility.</p>
		    <p>Medical diagnostic consumes a large part of hospital bills. Technology can move the routines of medical checks from a hospital (hospital-centric) to the patient&rsquo;s home (home-centric).</p>
		    <p>The right diagnosis will also lessen the need of hospitalization.</p>
		    <p>A new paradigm, known as the Internet of Things (IoT), has an extensive applicability in numerous areas, including healthcare.</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;</p>
		    <p>The full application of this paradigm in healthcare area is a mutual hope because it allows medical centers to function more competently and patients to obtain better treatment.</p>
		    <p>With the use of this technology-based healthcare method, there are unparalleled benefits which could improve the quality and efficiency of treatments and accordingly improve the health of the patients.</p>
		    <h2>Benefits</h2>
		    <h3>Simultaneous reporting and monitoring</h3>
		    <p>Real-time monitoring via connected devices can save lives in event of a medical emergency like heart failure, diabetes, asthma attacks, etc.</p>
		    <p><img src="images/benefits-of-iot-health-reporting-and-monitoring.jpg" alt="benefits of iot health reporting and monitoring" width="725" height="450"></p>
		    <p>With real-time monitoring of the condition in place by means of a smart medical device connected to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.peerbits.com/case-studies.html">smartphone app</a>, connected devices can collect medical and other required health data and use the data connection of the smartphone to transfer collected information to a physician.</p>
		    <p>Center of Connected Health Policy conducted a study that indicates that there was a 50% reduction in 30-day readmission rate because of remote patient monitoring on heart failure patients.</p>
		    <p>The IoT device collects and transfers health data: blood pressure, oxygen and blood sugar levels, weight, and ECGs.</p>
		    <p>These data are stored in the cloud and can be shared with an authorized person, who could be a physician, your insurance company, a participating health firm or an external consultant, to allow them to look at the collected data regardless of their place, time, or device.</p>

		    <h3>End-to-end connectivity and affordability</h3>
		    <p>IoT can automate patient care workflow with the help&nbsp;<a href="https://www.peerbits.com/healthcare-app-development.html">healthcare mobility solution</a>&nbsp;and other new technologies, and next-gen healthcare facilities.</p>
		    <p>IoT in healthcare enables interoperability, machine-to-machine communication, information exchange, and data movement that makes healthcare service delivery effective.</p>
		    <p>Connectivity protocols: Bluetooth LE, Wi-Fi, Z-wave, ZigBee, and other modern protocols, healthcare personnel can change the way they spot illness and ailments in patients and can also innovate revolutionary ways of treatment.</p>
		    <p>Consequently, technology-driven setup brings down the cost, by cutting down unnecessary visits, utilizing better quality resources, and improving the allocation and planning.</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;</p>
		    <h3>Data assortment and analysis</h3>
		    <p>Vast amount of data that a healthcare device sends in a very short time owing to their real-time application is hard to store and manage if the access to cloud is unavailable.</p>
		    <p>Even for healthcare providers to acquire data originating from multiple devices and sources and analyze it manually is a tough bet.</p>
		    <p>IoT devices can collect, report and analyses the data in real-time and cut the need to store the raw data.</p>
		    <p>This all can happen overcloud with the providers only getting access to final reports with graphs.</p>
		    <p>Moreover, healthcare operations allow organizations to get vital healthcare analytics and data-driven insights which speed up decision-making and is less prone to errors.</p>
		    <h3>Tracking and alerts</h3>
		    <p>On-time alert is critical in event of life-threatening circumstances. Medical IoT devices gather vital data and transfer that data to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.peerbits.com/blog/intelligent-wearables-are-coming-to-doctor-near-you.html">doctors for real-time tracking</a>, while dropping notifications to people about critical parts via mobile apps and other linked devices.</p>
		    <p><img src="images/benefits-of-iot-health-Tracking-and-alert.jpg" alt="benefits of iot health Tracking and alert" width="725" height="400"></p>
		    <p>Reports and alerts give a firm opinion about a patient&rsquo;s condition, irrespective of place and time.</p>
		    <p>It also helps make well-versed decisions and provide on-time treatment.</p>
		    <p>Thus, IoT enables real-time alerting, tracking, and monitoring, which permits hands-on treatments, better accuracy, apt intervention by doctors and improve complete patient care delivery results.</p>
		    <h3>Remote medical assistance</h3>
		    <p>In event of an emergency, patients can contact a doctor who is many kilometers away with a smart mobile apps.</p>
		    <p>With&nbsp;<a href="https://www.peerbits.com/mobile-application-development.html">mobility solutions</a>&nbsp;in healthcare, the medics can instantly check the patients and identify the ailments on-the-go.</p>
		    <p>Also, numerous healthcare delivery chains that are forecasting to build machines that can distribute drugs on the basis of patient&rsquo;s prescription and ailment-related data available via linked devices.</p>
		    <p><a href="https://www.peerbits.com/blog/how-healthcare-mobile-solution-improve-patient-care-in-hospital.html">IoT will Improve the patient&rsquo;s care In hospital.</a>&nbsp;This in turn, will cut on people&rsquo;s expanse on healthcare</p>
		    <h3>Research</h3>
		    <p>IoT for healthcare can also be used for research purposes. It&rsquo;s because IoT enables us to collect a massive amount of data about the patient&rsquo;s illness which would have taken many years if we collected it manually.</p>
		    <p>This data thus collected can be used for statistical study that would support the medical research.</p>
		    <p>Thus, IoT don&rsquo;t only saves time but also our money which would go in the research.</p>
		    <p>Thus, IoT has a great impact in the field of medical research. It enables the introduction of bigger and better medical treatments.</p>
		    <p>IoT is used in a variety of devices that enhance the quality of the healthcare services received by the patients.</p>
		    <p>Even the existing devices are now being updated by IoT by simply using embedding chips of a smart devices. This chip enhances the assistance and care that a patient requires.</p>
		    <h2>Challenges</h2>
		    <h3>Data security &amp; privacy</h3>
		    <p>One of the most significant threats that IoT poses is of data&nbsp;<a href="https://www.peerbits.com/blog/10-iot-security-concerns-to-keep-in-mind-before-developing-apps.html">security &amp; privacy</a>. IoT devices capture and transmit data in real-time.</p>
		    <p><img src="images/benefits-of-iot-health-data-security.jpg" alt="benefits of iot health data security" width="725" height="359"></p>
		    <p>However, most of the IoT devices lack data protocols and standards.</p>
		    <p>In addition to that, there is significant ambiguity regarding data ownership regulation.</p>
		    <p>All these factors make the data highly susceptible to&nbsp;<a href="https://vpnpro.com/blog/top-cybersecurity-threats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cybercriminals</a>&nbsp;who can hack into the system and compromise Personal Health Information (PHI) of both patients as well as doctors.</p>
		    <p>Cybercriminals can misuse patient&rsquo;s data to create fake IDs to buy drugs and medical equipment which they can sell later.</p>
		    <p>Hackers can also file a fraudulent Insurance claim in patient&rsquo;s name.</p>

	          </blockquote>
	      </div>
		    <h3>Integration: multiple devices &amp; protocols</h3>
		    <p>Integration of multiple devices also causes hindrance in the implementation of IoT in the healthcare sector.</p>
		    <p>The reason for this hindrance is that device manufacturers haven&rsquo;t reached a consensus regarding communication protocols and standard.</p>
		    <p>So, even if the variety of devices are connected; the difference in their communication protocol complicates and hinders the process of data aggregation.</p>
		    <p>This non-uniformity of the connected device&rsquo;s protocols slows down the whole process and reduces the scope of scalability of IoT in healthcare.</p>
		    <h3>Data overload &amp; accuracy</h3>
		    <p>As discussed earlier, data aggregation is difficult due to the use of different communication protocols &amp; standards.</p>
		    <p>However, IoT devices still record a ton of data. The data collected by IoT devices are utilized to gain vital insights.</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;</p>
		    <p>However, the amount of data is so tremendous that deriving insights from it are becoming extremely difficult for doctors which, ultimately affects the quality of decision-making.</p>
		    <p>Moreover, this concern is rising as more devices are connected which record more and more data.</p>
		    <h3>Cost</h3>
		    <p>Surprised to see cost considerations in the challenge sections? I know most of you would be; but the bottom line is: IoT has not made the healthcare facilitates affordable to the common man yet.</p>
		    <p>The boom in the Healthcare costs is a worrying sign for everybody especially the developed countries.</p>
		    <p>The situation is such that it gave rise to &ldquo;Medical Tourism&rdquo; in which patients with critical conditions access healthcare facilities of the developing nations which costs them as less as one-tenth. IoT in healthcare as a concept is a fascinating and promising idea.</p>

	      </div>
		    <p>However, it hasn&rsquo;t solved the cost considerations as of now. To successfully implement&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solutionanalysts.com/iot-internet-of-things-development/">IoT app development</a>&nbsp;and to gain its total optimization the stakeholders must make it cost effective otherwise it will always remain out of everyone&rsquo;s reach except the people from the high class.</p>
		    <h2>Applications of IoT in healthcare</h2>
		    <p>The rise of IoT is exciting for everybody due to its different scope of use in various sectors. In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.peerbits.com/works/medicall.html">Healthcare it has several applications</a>. IoT in healthcare helps in:</p>

		    <h3>Hearables</h3>
		    <p>Hearables are new-age hearing aids which have completely transformed the way people who suffered hearing loss interact with the world.</p>
		    <p><img src="images/benefits-of-iot-health-hearables.jpg" alt="healthcare mobile app developer" width="725" height="450"></p>
		    <p>Nowadays, hearables are compatible with Bluetooth which syncs your smartphone with it.</p>
		    <p>It allows you to filter, equalize and add layered features to real-world sounds. Doppler Labs is the most suitable example of it.</p>
		    <h3>Ingestible sensors</h3>
		    <p>Ingestible sensors are genuinely a modern-science marvel. These are pill-sized sensors which monitor the medication in our body and warns us if it detects any irregularities in our bodies.</p>
		    <p>These sensors can be a boon for a diabetic patient as it would help in curbing symptoms and provide with an early warning for diseases. Proteus Digital Health is one such example.</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;</p>
		    <h3>Moodables</h3>
		    <p>Moodables are mood enhancing devices which help in improving our mood throughout the day. It may sound like science fiction, but it&rsquo;s not far from reality.</p>
		    <p>Thync and Halo Neurosciences are already working on it and has made tremendous progress.</p>
		    <p>Moodables are head-mounted wearables that send low-intensity current to the brain which elevates our mood.</p>
		    <h3>Computer vision technology</h3>
		    <p>Computer vision technology along with AI has given rise to drone technology which aims to mimic visual perception and hence decision making based on it.</p>
		    <p><img src="images/benefits-of-iot-health-Computer-vision-technology.jpg" alt="benefits of iot health Computer vision technology" width="725" height="437"></p>
		    <p>Drones like Skydio use computer vision technology to detect obstacles and to navigate around them.</p>
		    <p>This technology can also be used for visually impaired people to navigate efficiently.</p>
		    <h3>Healthcare charting</h3>
		    <p>IoT devices such as Audemix reduce much manual work which a doctor has to do during patient charting.</p>
		    <p>It is powered by voice commands and captures the patient&rsquo;s data.</p>
		    <p>It makes the patient&rsquo;s data readily accessible for review. It saves around doctors&rsquo; work by 15 hours per week.</p>
